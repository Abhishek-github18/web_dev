      Manmohan Singh (Punjabi: [mənˈmoːɦən ˈsɪ́ŋɡ] ⓘ; 26 September 1932 – 26
      December 2024)[2][3] was an Indian politician, economist, academician, and
      bureaucrat who served as the prime minister of India from 2004 to 2014. He
      was the fourth longest-serving prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru,
      Indira Gandhi and Narendra Modi. A member of the Indian National Congress,
      Singh was the first Sikh prime minister of India. He was also the first
      prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to be re-elected after completing a
      full five-year term.[4][5] Born in Gah, West Punjab, in what is today
      Pakistan, Singh's family migrated to India during its partition in 1947.
      After obtaining his doctorate in economics from Oxford, Singh worked for
      the United Nations during 1966–1969. He subsequently began his
      bureaucratic career when Lalit Narayan Mishra hired him as an advisor in
      the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. During the 1970s and 1980s, Singh
      held several key posts in the Government of India, such as Chief Economic
      Advisor (1972–1976), governor of the Reserve Bank (1982–1985) and head of
      the Planning Commission (1985–1987). In 1991, as India faced a severe
      economic crisis, the newly elected prime minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao,
      inducted the apolitical Singh into his cabinet as finance minister. Over
      the next few years, despite strong opposition, he carried out several
      structural reforms that liberalised India's economy. Although these
      measures proved successful in averting the crisis, and enhanced Singh's
      reputation globally as a leading reform-minded economist, the incumbent
      Congress Party fared poorly in the 1996 general election. Subsequently,
      Singh was leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of
      the Parliament of India) during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government of
      1998–2004. In 2004, when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance Came
      to power, its chairperson Sonia Gandhi unexpectedly relinquished the prime
      ministership to Singh. His first ministry executed several key
      legislations and projects, including the National Rural Health Mission,
      Unique Identification Authority, Rural Employment Guarantee scheme and
      Right to Information Act. In 2008, opposition to a historic civil nuclear
      agreement with the United States nearly caused Singh's government to fall
      after Left Front parties withdrew their support. India's economy grew
      rapidly during his term. The 2009 general election saw the UPA return with
      an increased mandate, with Singh retaining the office of prime minister.
      Over the next few years, Singh's second ministry government faced a number
      of corruption charges over the organisation of the 2010 Commonwealth
      Games, the 2G spectrum allocation case and the allocation of coal blocks.
      After his term ended, he opted out from the race for the office of prime
      minister during the 2014 Indian general election.[6] Singh was never a
      member of the Lok Sabha but served as a member of the Rajya Sabha,
      Representing the state of Assam from 1991 to 2019 and Rajasthan from 2019
      to 2024.[7][8] Early life and education Singh was born to Gurmukh Singh
      and Amrit Kaur on 26 September 1932, in Gah, Punjab, British India (now in
      Punjab, Pakistan), into a Sikh family.[9] His mother died when he was very
      young.[10][11] His paternal grandmother raised him, and he was very close
      to her.[11] His early schooling was in the Urdu medium, and even as prime
      minister years later, he wrote his apparently Hindi speeches in the Urdu
      script, although sometimes he would also use Gurmukhi, a script used to
      write Punjabi, his mother tongue. After the Partition of India, his family
      migrated to Haldwani, India.[10] In 1948 they relocated to Amritsar, where
      he studied at Hindu College, Amritsar.[10][12] He attended Panjab
      University, then in Hoshiarpur,[13][14][15] Punjab, studying Economics and
      got his bachelor's and master's degrees in 1952 and 1954, respectively,
      standing first throughout his academic career. He completed his Economics
      Tripos at University of Cambridge in 1957. He was a member of St John's
      College.[16]
